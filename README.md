# Lambda - Random Number Generator

Lambda is a class in java that contains methods to deal with random number generation,
further more deals with sampling from a variety of distributions as well as other functionalities.
\
\
The idea for creating this class stemmed from the course STAT2003 - Mathemtical Probability,
a course which takes a student through sampling from distributions and random number generation
as well as learning to work with probability and cumulative density functions.


## Features

- Pseudo-random Number Generation (using linear congruential generators)
- Ability to sample from numerous distributions (exponential, normal, etc.)
- Numerical approximation to the error function
- Handy functions dealing with CDF's (alike `pnorm()` in `R`)
- Shuffle arrays and lists
- Finds all permutations of a given integer array
